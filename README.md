# DSS-Duos

**DSS Duos** is a simple pairing algorithm I made to arrange club-wide pair socials for my data science club at Berkeley (Data Science Society). Especially during quarantine, club attendance and participation dropped very low, so as a culture committee member, I coded up and organized this system called DSS Duos to encourage club members to stay connected.
